# Situational Awareness
## Defining situational awareness  
 
	  > The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) defines situational awareness as “being aware of what is happening around you in terms of where you are, where you are supposed to be, and whether anyone or anything around you is a threat to your health and safety”.  

  Situational awareness therefore enables an individual to make the most appropriate decision to ensure their own safety and that of others who may be exposed to the threat. In essence, it requires an individual to have:  
- An **awareness/perception** of the environment in which they work and the consequent **hazards/threats**.  
- The comprehension to analyse the situation and potential risks from hazards/threats, the ability to respond in an appropriate manner to avoid the risks or reduce their impact.

    As such, it is clear that where situational awareness is a key risk control element, organisations should be determining how they can ensure employees acquire appropriate levels of situational awareness.  

#### Improving situational awareness  
According to the HSE, the process of improving situational awareness is to get into the habit of “*regularly pausing to make a quick mental assessment of your environment*”. When doing so, it suggests that the individual should consider the following questions.  
- Is there anything around that poses a threat to your health and safety and to what extent?  
- Is the threat so serious that work should be stopped?  
- Is there anything that you can do safely to reduce the threat in order to carry on working safely?
  
Clearly with this approach, employees will need to be provided with the necessary information, instruction and training to enable them to identify the threats, analyse how serious those threats are and what action should be taken in controlling the risks.  

#### “SLAM” technique to ensure employees improve situational awareness.  
- **STOP**: employees should engage their minds before their hands and look at the task to be completed.  
- **LOOK**: employees should look at the workplace and find the hazards to them and other employees and report these immediately to a supervisor.  
- **ASSESS**: employees should assess the effects the hazard may have on them and other persons, equipment, procedures, pressures and the environment. Employees should ask themselves if they have the appropriate knowledge, training and tools to do the task safely.  
- **MANAGE**: if employees feel unsafe they should stop working and tell supervisors and other persons. They should also tell the supervisor what action they believe is necessary to make the situation safe.  

The HSE states that “*by using the **SLAM** technique workers will value the importance of health and safety and so help create a healthy and safe site*” and by remembering **SLAM**, “*workers are more likely to stop work if a task appears unsafe or risky to their health, or stop their colleagues behaving in an unsafe or unhealthy way*”.
