- What are you doing later today? - can you tell the group more about that activity/give vocab? 

**Tongue Twisters** - introduce the group to some tongue twisters in English, write them on the board, ask someone if they want to give one a go. Then you read it slowly and encourage everyone to try either one at a time if they want or all together. Highlight any pronunciation corrections and introduce them to the vocab.
Further the activity ask them to give you a french tongue twister. You read it badly ask them to translate it for you see if they can work together to explain what it means to you.

- Would you rather be able to control fire or water?

**Would I lie to you** - split the class into groups of 3 or 4 give the class the list of prompts and ask each of them to come up with a story that is either true or false. They then tell their story to the rest of the group the other teams vote if it is true or false. 

**Directions guided around a grid** - set out a 4 by 4 grid with 16 cones. Pair the group up and give each pair a blindfold, and a direction sheet. Go over relevant vocab (right, left, forward, backwards, stop, go, turn) and then set the teams to go around the course.

**Further the activity** - if the group isn't doing team games. Now take the group down to the night line and tell the group they will now guide each other around here. For that they will need some more vocab, demonstrate the actions they will need words for to see if they know them if they don't tell them. (step over, duck down, crouch, lift up the rope, push down the rope.

Tell me about where you live (school groups) get the whiteboard and place it on the table tell them you are going to draw what they tell you about the area they live in. As they tell you about their town draw exactly what they describ. After you have drawn a few things check with them if this looks correct, if it is wrong tell them that they must describe it more specifically give them words to help with this if you need to. 

**Centre vocab** - place a variety of items from the activity tent on the ground, introduce the participants to all the items. Tell them you will say an item and they need to run to the correct item. 

**People bingo (Colo groups)** - a good activity for the first day. Give everyone a people bingo sheet, talk through the sheet with them and then set the off to fill out the sheet with a different person for each question. 

Talk to the group about numbers suffexes and how it is different from french - 1st - 2nd - 3rd - 4th….. compared to 1ier 2 eme 3 eme 

**Order yourselves by...** - give the group a selection of categories to order themselves by (Ideally do this with the group balancing on the wooden planks by the volley ball net - they can't touch the ground).

**Write a story as a group** - tell the group they will write a story together but they can only say three words each, this story can either be written on the board so they can all see it or you can just write it so you can see. Every time a sentence ends recap the story so far. End the activity when group enthusiasm starts to wain.

**Songs** - give each person in the group a fill in the lyrics sheets they can work on their own or in small groups. Play the song in sections so the group can fill out the sheet. 

**Splat** - to start the game you  stand in the middle of the circle, explain the following rules, the middle person will spin around and when they stop point at a person and say a catagory the person pointed to ducks and the two people stood on either side must turn to each other with their arms out and say something that fits into the catagory.  The slowest person is then out and sits down. The game continues until there are two people left who them stand back to back. You then count to 3 they take a step as you say each number and then say the final catagory. Make sure you introduce the catagories and that everyone understands them. 

**Simon says** - introduce the game and then introduce action and body part vocab 

- e.g wave your hand
- Jump up and down
- Touch your nose 
- Balance on your right leg

**Pictionary** - split the class into two groups they will have a pictionary race you will have one list of words and each group must race to get to the bottom of the list. The list can be themed or random; you can take suggestions from the group for words if you want.

**Just a minute** - different levels of rules for abilities but the bases is someone must talk about a subject for a length of time. 

- Time can be anywhere from 20 seconds to a minute
- They can be allowed no pauses or hesitation, they can be unlimited or they could be given a limit of 5 
- They can choose the topic or you can 
- They can have time to prepare for no time to prepare 

**Pass the bomb** - have an item with a timer - phone, watch etc. give the group a category or a letter or both and the group has to pass the item around the room if the timer stops on them they lose a life each player has 3 lives stop the game either when the first person loses all their lives or group enthusiasm wanes.

**Hangman** - this game can have two levels either make a list of new words the group has been introduced to over their lessons - write up this list then play the game with these words - or don’t give them a list of words to guess from.

**Charades** - ask the group to pick a theme for all the words to be from.

**Stop the bus** - letter categories/ match in time - 2 points for only person with a word, 1 point if they match with someone else. 

**Taboo** - can’t use word team must describe word for person to guess - time limit.

**A or An** - a super simple game for a group with basic english get the group to line up in the middle between to trees (any two marked places) label one side a and one side an.  All they need to do is run to the word which is appropriate to the word you give them.  Now explain the english rule, if a word starts with a vowels it has to be an if it starts with a consonant it has a before it.  - a good way to explain it might be it is similar to french where you also don’t want two vowels together so use L’ insead of la/le.

**Madlibs** - write a short story on a whiteboard leaving gaps for participants to fill in the word when given a category. Templates and examples can be found online. But for example they think of an adjective, noun, or can be more specific, place, temperature, animal 

**Diaries** - most groups choose not to have extra sessions but can we offer it as in the lesson?
