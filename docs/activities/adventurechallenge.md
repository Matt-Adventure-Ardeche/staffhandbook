# Adventure Challenge

Advnture Challenge is an activity which includes a 3km walk into Salavas. This is the closest village to Base du Cros. Salavas is an ancient village with remnants of a castle, narrow alley ways and old stone houses with their shuttered windows and rustic wooden doorways, so reminiscent of the local French life.

Starting from the Base du Cros the clients follow the riverside footpath in a upstream direction. Soon entering an area of wooded terrain. Varoius terrain (Sand Beach, Pebble Beach, Flood Zones) and the village itslf provide many aspects of the local environment to discuss with the groups.

During the walk the clients should be provided with many questions, discussions and small challenges that encourage and engage participation and raise awareness of the groups surroundings.  After some time in the village where they will complete a kind of treasure hunt, the group will make its way back to Base du Cros via small and quiet roads that can also provie further opportunities for engagement.

To maximise the activity potential, leaders will need to ensure group control, encourage developmental activities, and share knowledge of environmental/cultural informations to create learning from the experience.
