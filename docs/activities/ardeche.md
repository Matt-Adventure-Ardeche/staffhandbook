# Ardeche Descent

The Ardeche Descent can be split into two distinct options - the **Mini-Descent** and the **Full Descent**.

## Mini Descent
The *Mini* is a full day activity that takes place on the Ardeche River between Base du Cros and Chames. Participants use *Sit on Top* kayaks as tandem teams. During the descent the group will pass through four rapids (*Post-Office A and Post-Office B, Les Branches, and Charlemagne*), before passing under **Pont d'Arc**. The first part of the day is spent learning how to paddle, playing some games, having races. This part takes place right at Base du Cros. After lunch the group then get back on the water for the descent itself.

Before the descent the group receive a *River Briefing* which includes a Safety / Coaching talk, reiterate this information again, directly before heading downstream. The group are divided into *Cells* each with an Instructor and River Leader to guide them.

Participants will enjoy a great time on the water. Learning various paddling skills, teamwork, and communication. The amazing landscape is right there in your faces in which you will immerse the group. Successfully navigating the river, getting an adrenaline rush on the rapids are just two indicators of a good day.

## Full Descent
The *Full* is a two day activity. Starting at Chames (Stop 6) and concluding at Sauze 29km later.

The day starts with the *Initiation* - a very brief introduction to the required skills needed to keep the kayak going the right direction..!  From here there are plenty of opportunities to continue giving *Top Tips* to the group.

As the group start the descent the soon enter the Gorge proper at Trois Eaux rapid. Around the corner at the next rapid the group will stop for lunch.  Maybe a swim down the rapid to practice the correct WhiteWater swim techniques. From here the rapids are pretty regular.  Also as we descend there are opportunities to jump from rocks into the river.  The jumps are specific, only those signed off can be used.

Day one concludes at the bottom of the Le Mas rapid where the kayaks and canoes will be stored. The group change into dry footwear for the hike up to Le Mas itself. From here the coach will be waiting to return the group to either Base du Cros or Vagnas for the night.
Day two begins witht the coach journey back to Le Mas, where the group will reverse the trail from the day previous and hike down to the beach at Le Mas rapid.  Re-launching in to the river to begin the descent to the end.  Just around the corner is Gournier Rapid and the bivouac site. There is a tap here if you need to refill any water containers.

After Gournier more rapids and opportunities to swim or jump present themselves.  Soon the group reach Windy Corner and we all hope that the wind is with us or absent alltogether.! As we get close to the end the walls of the gorge begin to reduce in size and the river once again gets busy with tourists etc.
