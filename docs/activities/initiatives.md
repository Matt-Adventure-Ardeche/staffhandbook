# Initiatives

Intiatives are activities that aim to bring *Team Spirit* closer to the participants. Through mentally and physically challenging activities. The principle of together we are stronger is emphasised.  Within the session, the group participants  will solve problems taking the strengths of each individual into consideration. Emphasis is placed on the environment in which each participant feels comfortable. Encourage participants to step slightly beyond their comfort zone. 

A good format for delivering these activities is to try and make the focus progressive or in a particular area to highlight the needs of the group. Not easy when you may not have worked directly with the respective individuals... Coordinate with the other staff you are working alongside to create a **Round-Robin** of activities so as not to clash with each other. Choose locations for each activity that require moving a reasonable distance.  This additional space allows you to chat with the group to illicit reflection on the learning. Ask **Open** Questions to elicit feedback that is positive and constructive from the participants. Ask **How** they will use this learning in the next activity, **How** they will transfer the overall learning to thier own lives...  This **Reflective** practice is what you are aiming for.

### 1. Magic Carpet
Take a tarp and lay it on the floor. The group must all stand on it, then they must keep
folding it until they cannot stand on it anymore. They may also try different techniques to
take up less room.

### 2. Woosh, Boink, Pow, Panic, Sea Cucumber
The group must gather round in a circle having a bit more than two arms length between
each other. They may *Woosh* the people beside them in a single direction by sweeping their
arms to the side. If a person *Boinks* you (by crossing their arms) then it goes back in the opposite
direction. If a person *Pows* they may send it to any person in the circle. If a person shouts *Panic* all
the group must run in random directions whilst shouting. If a person evokes *Sea Cucumber*
they must all cross their wrists above their heads and do a *“oooowoooooowoooooo”*.

### 3. Human Knot
Get a piece of rope joined at the ends, mess it up so it’s placed randomly. The group then pick up a random
piece of the rope with one hand. They must then communicate verbally or non-verbally to untangle.

### 4. Folding Rope half + half again
The rope is put in a circle on the ground. Each person must not step out of the circle. The rope is
folded in half every time they succeed.

### 5. Human Knot with hands
The groups must randomly hold each other’s hands. They must then try to untangle themselves
without letting go of each other to get into a circle.

### 6. Fire triangle with coins
Scatter 3 types of chips on the floor. Explain how to make a fire: you need ignition, oxygen,
fuel, which is what is represented by each of these chips. Play a first round where each person
must pick up one of each so that they may make a fire.
**Variations:** invent situations where they would have to pick up multiple of one chip
e.g. The firemen have arrived with a new foam that takes away oxygen, now the group must
pick up an extra oxygen.

### 7. Holding hands, everyone passes through a loop of rope
The group get into a circle and hold hands. A bit of rope is around one of their arms. The
task is to pass the rope all around the circle.
**Variation:** there are two loops of rope, one goes clockwise, and the other anticlockwise.

### 8. Animal game, names + actions
The group form a semi-circle. One by one, they choose an animal and associate a
gesture to it. Each time the chosen animal is smaller than the previous one.
An example would be easier to explain. They say “animal 1 to animal 5”, giving the gesture
every time they say an animal. Then “animal 5 to animal 3” and so on. If a child makes a
mistake he then moves to the bottom of chain to become the smallest animal and all the
others move up which changes all of the persons animal names.

### 9. Skinning the Snake 
The group line up one behind the other. The participants put their left arm through their legs
(behind) and their right hand catches the left hand of the person in front. The aim is that the
order is reversed, the first one needs to be at the back and the last one at the front. The idea
is that they pass between each other’s legs. *See how comfortable the group is.* This is all done while keeping feet on the ground.

### 10. Trust Falls
This can be a consequential activity if the group aren’t comfortable and don’t pay attention.
The aim is that one person falls backwards and the others catch them.
**Variation:** increase height of fall.

### 11. Line up by order of birthday, age etc…
The group randomly get onto a long plank of wood, along a length of rope, a roadside kerb etc. They must line up by order of something
without speaking or setting a foot off of the surface. E.g. birthday, age, height…

### 12. Black magic
Two group (participant **A** and participant **B**) come up with a sign/signal. The rest of the group choose a
visible object in their surroundings. Particiapnt **A** sits down with the group and gets told which
object they have chosen, participant **B** stands in front of the group. Participant **A** says objects to participant **B**,
using the pre-established signal participant **B** must correctly say which item is the chosen one. The
aim for the rest of the group is to guess the signal. If a participant thinks they have guessed the signal
they then stand up and try it out for him or herself. The aim is that all the group figure this out.

### 13. Sit in circle with hands on rope, then try to stand up
A circle of rope is folded into half 3 or 4 times. All the group sit in a circle holding onto the
circle of rope. Their goal is to stand up only using their legs and the rope.
**Variations:** unfold the rope, one handed, one legged...

### 14. Toxic Waste
A small *“toxic”* barrel is placed on a bigger barrel, it is surrounded by a big circle of rope
which the group cannot enter. Beside the big circle is a “safe zone” hoop. The group
have at their disposal: a few long-ish ropes, an elastic. The group’s goal is to move the barrel
without touching it, into the safe zone hoop.

### 15. Traffic Lights
If you have x participants, make x+1 cones on the floor in a line. Separate the group into two
halves. Put a line on the ground and get the group to line up one behind the other on each side
facing each other. On one side put a space between the line and the first person. The aim is for
all the group to be on the opposite side of the line. They may go forwards one cone, or go
to the cone behind the person immediately in front of them.

### 16. Wind in the Willows
The group stand around in a tight circle (shoulder to shoulder), one person is in the middle
who keeps their feet (always) on the ground and keeps is legs, body and head as straight as
possible. They then fall into their groups hands, the group must pass them around the circle.
- **Variation:** make the circle bigger.

### 17. 3 hands, 4 feet, 2 thumbs, 1 ear
Give the group an amount of body parts that must touch the ground. As a group they must
work together to achieve this goal.

### 18. Night Line
A long rope course is set up. The participants are blindfolded. They must keep one hand on the rope
and the other on the shoulder of the person in front of them. The aim is to get around the
whole course without letting go of the rope. They are guided by one person.
**Variations:** Work in pairs; Work in pairs (non-verbal communication)

### 19. Hoola Hoop Race
Multiple hoops are placed on the floor touching each other. The group are split into two
teams, each of them starting at the opposite end of the hoop track. One person from each
team must bunny hop from hoop to hoop until they come across a person from the
opposing team, they must play rock paper scissors, the winner continues bunny hopping and
the loser goes to the opposing team. This goes on until someone has reached the opposing
teams side by bunny hopping.

### 20. Mine Field
Set cones to make a 4 by 4 box. On a piece of paper your note down the correct route.
The group must find this route. If they step into a wrong square, return to the side (1 minute penalty),
if not the instructor stays quiet. The participants are not allowed to speak to each other if they’re on
the boxes, they may when they are not.
- **Variation:** more boxes, non-verbal communication

### 21. Making shape with a rope and moving from A to B
All the participants form into a circle of rope and lean their back to the side of the rope to make a
shape. They must then move from a **point A** to a **point B** which are given by the instructor.

### 22. Twenty-One Game
The group must count to 21. Everytime a participant says 21, they may change any number to a
word/action/number. They must then count to 21 with the new word instead of the
number. They must change all 21 numbers into words, every mistake makes them restart.

### 23. Chicken, Seed, Fox
Split the group into sub-groups of 4 to 6. Each group have a *“raft”* which could be anything
circular. They must work out how to get the farmer, the chicken, the seed and the fox from
one side of the river to the other. The farmer must be in the raft at all times and can only
take one of the three others with him at a time. Keeping in mind, the fox will eat the chicken
and the chicken will eat the seed.

### 24. **Two** Fairy-Tales, **One** Truth
Give the group a topic. In groups of 3 they must each tell a story related to that topic. The
other sub-groups must guess which one is telling the truth.

### 25. Magic Stick
Split the group into sub-groups. Have each face the other. Arms out-streched, with index fingers pointing and overlapping the other group.  Balance a wand on the backs of the fingers. The aim is to lower the wand to the ground without any fingers loosing contact.  The *usual* outcome is that the wand heads to the clouds first...
**Variation:** Once done successfully, have the group repeat the task in silence.

### 26. Team Ski's
Using the *ski's* to travel a set distance without falling off.  If anyone touches the ground, restart..!
