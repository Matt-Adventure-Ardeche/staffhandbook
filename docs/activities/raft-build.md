# Raft Build

Raft Build is a team-work session where the group are given six poles and four barrels, plus some lengths of rope.. With this equipment the group are tasked with designing and building their raft.  The raft must of course float and stay together when on the water.  Failure to ensure this means a **LOT** of work for the instructor.!

Start the session with teaching the group to tie the knots required - mostly a *Figure-8* and a *Modified Square Lashing*. Once the group understand the knots, have them come up with a design. In reality groups all over the world end up with the **ONE DESIGN** ubiquitous to this activity worldwide. While building the raft ensure that you maintain good control of *Manual Handling* methods, clients should share the moving of loads and carry poles by their ends using two persons minimum. If you can find shade , use that area for the build, however also consider the distance to the water which the group will have to carry the finished structure.

Ensure that you are on or very close to the water as the group launch their creation.  Discuss with your group how they are going to distribute themselves on the raft.

Once on the water and floating carry out basic **Sea Trials**. Paddle forwards, backwards and turn left and right, plus don't forget to teach the group how to stop... Consider the environment you are operating in - it is busy, can be windy or there may be significant current - adapt where your boundaries are based on the above plus the ability of the group.

There are plenty of games and activities you can employ, also set up a race with other raft groups. At all times when playing, be mindful of the way the group are using their paddles, limit any splashing to avoid people getting hit in the face...

If the group have built a good raft, your ole is one of initiator and motivator; if the group have built a poor raft and you have let them do so, then your role will be one of debris collector..!
