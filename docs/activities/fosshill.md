# Foss Hill

**Foss Hill** is a small hike that develops/educates the clients about their own understanding of the environmental (Fauna, Flora, Landscapes, Geology.)  The hike is a circuit offering various routes where clients have to orientate themselves using a map and visual clues/ cue sheets.  During the hike there will be various learning points and activities/exercises that promote interaction within the group.

The path begins within the grounds at **Base du Cros**, and continues along the road in a westerly direction for approx 1km.  At a large parking area, on the left as you approach along the road, you will find the path steadily ascending for approx 20 minutes. At an intersection clients will have to decide which direction to take. For you, the instructor, this indicates either a *clockwise* or *anti-clockwise* route choice. The main route completes a loop around the hill.

At some point along the trail you will arrive at a breathtaking viewpoint where clients can enjoy a 108 degree panorama.  Below is the Base du Cros, to your left the *'Rocket Base'* on its own hill-top, in front and below the **Ardeche River**, the village and town of both Salavas & Vallon Pont d'Arc, directly in front above Vallon is the building of **Chauvet 2**, harder to see is the top of Pont d'Arc itself, remember to tell the clients about *Post Office Rock*... The summit of Fos Hill is an amazing place to take a group photo, but be very mindfull about the situation and environment around you.! Remember **Safety First**.

Continuing along the trail, the route twists and turns along narrow, shady ways until you eventually rejoin the upward trail and once again return to the car-park area at the road..
