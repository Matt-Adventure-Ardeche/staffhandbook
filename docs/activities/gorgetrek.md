# Gorge Trek
The **Gorge Trek** is a Grande Randonne. It follows the Ardeche river. The participants will pass through many areas of interest, and zonal differences.

The trek starts at the hamlet of *Le Crotte* and concludes close to Le Mas.  Shortly after setting off the group can visit the sobering memorial in Le Crotte to the victims of Nazi aggression, do not forget to tell their story...

We now follow the small trails through forest areas and begin to navigate our way down from the Ardeche plataux towards the river.  Teach the group how to orientate the map and have them lead the way. As you descend the path narrows and steepens, good group control is required. Eventually you reach the edge of the river with spectacular views up and down stream of the river flowing through the high limestone walls.

Follow the direction of the river. Sandy trails and some rocky beaches lead to, maybe, the most exciting section. Via Ferrata sections allow you to cross steep slabs of rock where a slip would lead to a swim... Be very careful here and maintain good control of the group.

Eventually you and the group will reach the ancient site of a former camp and bar called *'Chataignerie'* or **Chat** for short. There used to be a cable way here from the top of the plataux down to this place. Now overgrown and in ruins.  There is a trail here that winds its way steeply back up the walls of the gorge. Pass through the once locked *StarGate* to finally come out at the top of the old cableway. You are now very close to the end of the walk. make sure to take time to have one last view over the gorge as you make the final steps.
