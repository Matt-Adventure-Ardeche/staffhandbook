# Icebreakers

## **Icebreaker 1** – What will you take and what will you bring?

This is the best example of a fun icebreaker that not only allows you to get to know each other better, but also immediately sets a clear intention.

This icebreaker can be plenary or in pairs. In the latter case, go to someone you have not spoken to before and discuss the following three or four questions together:

* Who are you?
* What are you doing? (This is optional)
* What are you coming to get?
* What will you bring?

## **Icebreaker 2** – Why are you here?

Go to someone you haven’t spoken to yet and address these 3 questions together:

* Who are you?
* Why are you here?
* Who is your favorite superhero?

## **Icebreaker 3** – Two truths, one fairytale

This is a very funny and fun introductory game. This can be done in a plenary session or in pairs.

* The person whose turn it is is going to tell 3 things about themselves. One of those things is a lie.
* The rest can guess which of the three is a lie (fairytale is a more positive word).

## **Icebreaker 4** – The massage train

* Say, “You may have had a long day / week.”
* “Get up, turn a quarter turn.”
* “Put your arms on the shoulders of the other person in front of you.”
* “Start massaging.”

Turn on some music.
Also massage the spine.
Also try scratching.
Also think about the ears.
And it is going to rain! All raindrops on the head.
And a storm is coming!

## **Icebreaker 5** – Ask the other person as many questions as possible (and then introduce this person)

* Make pairs. Take turns questioning the other: you ask as many questions as possible about the other so that you can find out as much as possible about this person.
* As soon as this exercise is over, you will introduce the second round in plenary: everyone will introduce the person who has just been asked to the whole group! How much do you know to remember and tell the group?

## **Icebreaker 6** – Deep or funny questions with no name round

Why not start deep right away? Do not do a name round (you can hide behind it) but immediately ask the deep questions from the article with questions to get to know someone better.

Another thing that works very well is asking one funny question in front of the whole group. For example: which two ingredients do you really like to combine, while others think it’s really crazy? Have everyone answer in plenary.

## **Icebreaker 7** – Ignore VS Greet as best friend

This exercise requires the group to step out of its comfort zone, but the results are impressive! This breaks the ice very effectively.

**Round 1:** everyone walks through the room while music is playing. When the music stops, you walk up to someone and greet the other without really paying attention to the other.
**Round 2:** everyone walks around the room and when the music stops this time, you walk up to someone and pretend to see your best friend again after a long time.

It is now definitely broken and the group could draw some nice conclusions from it as a bonus, such as: greet everyone! Or: your smile is powerful!

## **Icebreaker 8** – Eye gazing icebreaker

Look at the other person for 2 minutes before you shake hands and introduce yourself.

    > If you look strangers in the eye for a minute (or longer), they are no longer strangers. When you look people in the eye for so long, you suddenly realize that you really make contact – that you really see the other.

## **Icebreaker 9** – Introduce yourself through a metaphor

Use a metaphor to introduce yourself.

## **Icebreaker 10** – Simple introductory icebreaker

Everyone tells their name, age and their favorite activity / what you like.

## **Icebreaker 11** – Cross the line / left or right of the room if …

Create two areas that people can walk to. Then speak questions and statements that can be answered by walking (or crossing the line) to one of these areas. This has become known as a teaching method for children, but it can also be used well for adults.

## **Icebreaker 12** – Have something to discuss in pairs

This icebreaker immediately serves as a substantive introduction to your presentation / workshop. Give a theorem or theory to pairs. Have them discuss this statement.

## **Icebreaker 13** – The wind blows for …

Say, “The wind blows for … {Anyone who has a pet}. This is a kind of musical chairs. You have to get up and find a new place if the statement is true for you.

## **Icebreaker 14** – Never have I …

* Everyone holds up 5 fingers.
* Go down the circle one by one. Each person tells something that he / she has never done (each activity may only pass once. The sentence always starts with: “Never have I …” For example: “I have never been to the US.”
* For every statement that is said, everyone in the group who has already done such a thing (ie has been to Europe) has to lower a finger, leaving 4 fingers.
* The goal is to stay in the game for as long as possible, so to be the last person to have fingers up. To win, it’s a good strategy to say something that most people have done but not you! Be creative and crazy (but not mean of course).

## **Icebreaker 15** – Organize in silence

Simply make the announcement that you want everyone to stand next to each other in order of date of birth. The only problem: no talking. Once they’re all lined up, ask certain people for their birthday to make sure.

You can also do the same with shoe size, height, etc.

## **Icebreaker 16** – The memory game

This is a challenging icebreaker game in which the group is immediately put to work.

* Make groups of 6 people and stand in a circle.
* Everyone always tells one thing about themselves. Complete the round.
* When the round is complete, the second round starts. You always list everything that people have said before you about themselves. So when it is your turn during the second round, mention what they said about themselves about all 5 other people.
* We are still in the second round. You have just gone all the way and you have come back to yourself. Now say again what you said about yourself in the first round and you add a second fact about yourself.
* In the third round, everyone mentions all of the above and always adds something extra.
* Continue like this for three rounds, and if all goes well you can continue for more rounds.

**Variation:** You can also play the game with each other’s goals. With each extra round, the goal of the goal is stated: what does that yield you?

Then you can go straight to a ‘context for discovery’: how do you remember all of everyone’s information? This icebreaker has several effects:

* You quickly get to know each other because you get a lot of information about each other.
* You gain access to different representation systems  of yourself.
* It’s a nice memory workout.
* You will become familiar with TOTE strategies.
* You are engaged in following and leading.
* You are learning inductively: by discovering yourself.
* You become familiar with omissions, distortions and generalizations of the metamodel.
* You become familiar with giving information at different logical levels of Bateson.
* You look at what kind of information people prefer to give: about things, people, places, information etc?
* You look in which direction the eyes go.
* It’s fun.
* You remember each other’s names.
* You learn to make rapport with each other because you use exactly the same words of the other.

## **Icebreaker 17** – Introduce yourself by using the photos on your mobile

* Make pairs and go and see the last 10 photos together on your mobile. Introduce the other accordingly.

## **Icebreaker 18** – Find as many things you have in common as possible

* Make pairs. Identify as many similarities between the two of you as possible. “I do Yoga.” “Me too!”
* Meet in plenary and tell us how it went.
* Send the group away again to do the same in pairs, only this time you point them to the model of the logical levels.  Suddenly, this offers a lot more opportunities to find similarities because we often tend to say “You have black hair too!” and behavior level “You also play the piano!” to search. With the model of the logical levels you can also look at capacities, beliefs, values, identity and mission. “You are also good at connecting with people!” You also believe the keto diet is the best diet! “” You want to invite more people to parties too! “

## **Icebreaker 19** – Do something connecting, such as singing and / or holding hands

An icebreaker can also be really intimate. Stand together in a circle, take each other’s hands and sing something beautiful together. If it’s not a well-known song, sing an improvised musical together.
