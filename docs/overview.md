# Overview

This online document is essentially a **HANDBOOK** to guide you through the systems in place at **Adventure Ardeche**.

!!! tip ""
    Those systems are laid out in the menu on the left in order of need.

The handbook is provided so that staff have a easily accessible reference to the informations, systems, other resources etc to hand. It is also available as a paper based resource in the Centre Managers office and Activity Managers office.

The handbook is designed so that whenever a staff member is unsure of their requirements they can firstly refer to the handbook, before then approaching either the Activity Manager or Centre Manager for further clarification of their query.

The information contained here is under a continual process of updating and development.  **Critical Information** ie. *Risk Assessments* or *Policies & Procedures* are reviewed yearly or after an incident.

    Critical Information should not change, and if it does, staff will be informed through the **staff meeting** channel.

Your contribution is essential to expanding, simplifing, and editing the information contained here. Please feel free to suggest any changes, amendments, or additions to either the Activity Manager or Centre Manager or one of the **Leadership Team**.
