# Expectations

## Staff Expectations
The ability to introduce, present, instruct and enthuse about the subject or activity you are employed for.

An up-to-date knowledge of all safety and technical aspects of the subject or activity for which you are employed.

The ability to effectively manage the activity for which you are employed, and to deal effectively with all worst-case scenarios that you might encounter during the activity, hence all instructors must make available use of all appropriate safety equipment and familiarise themselves with respective emergency procedures.

The ability to enable, motivate and support each and every individual customer: We do not expect staff to run "**standard**" activities, i.e. if one individual needs greater attention than another, we expect that it be provided with skill and without prejudice in order that that individual gains as much as they desire, rather than being required to conform to "normal" requirements.

    **Note**
    
    We expect that staff will go out of their way for our customers! A polite, courteous and supportive approach to all customers, members of the public and fellow staff members.

- That the Leadership Team is informed about any personal issue that may affect the quality of any aspect of your operation:
    * Such information should be given openly, and at the earliest possible opportunity.  
    * We expect that staff will go out of their way to ensure that this happens.

* An up-to-date knowledge and awareness of legal responsibilities, Health and Safety issues, PPE regulations, and risk assessment requirements.

* That all accidents, incidents and near misses are reported.

* That all first aid treatments are reported.

* That any information about guests that might be required prior to medical treatment, is obtained, recorded, and passed on to others only on a need to know basis, in confidence, and at the earliest opportunity.

* That any questions regarding Health and Safety, guest care, professional duty, and any other matter between guest(s), and Adventure Ardeche personnel are referred to the Leadership Team at the earliest opportunity.

### Code of Practice
For the safety and wellbeing of those involved in any activities during an Adventure Ardeche activity.

!!! info ""
    **Info**

    The purpose of this code is to state the practice that should be in use during any activity in relation to organisational, safety, and the physical well-being of everyone concerned. 

### This code will be successfully operational when:

* A good working relationship and clear communication exists between the staff running the activity and their guests and the Leadership Team.

* We (*all staff involved*) carefully plan and prepare all activities and identify special and particular needs as early as practicable

* We clearly define objectives for the activity, relating to the age group and type of our guests, and clearly identify the overall aims of each guest and guest group

* Each instructor, or facilitator is competent to deliver the activity for which they have been employed

* Our resources and facilities are well managed.

* Adventure Ardeche staff must always be prepared to adapt, and to be flexible in their outlook, and in their management of resources to ensure that we create a safe and enjoyable experience for all the guests who have placed their trust in our organisation.

* The information contained in this document is intended to be guidance for all people working within Adventure Ardeche. It is expected that all people working within Adventure Ardeche read, digest and use this information, and where they recognise that improvements could be made, they take it upon themselves to inform the Leadership Team.

* We support the development of and interaction between staff and the Leadership Team with the intention of improving the odds against unsafe operation in hazardous situations.

* We foresee that any staff member may opt to take actions that fall outside the scope of this document in order to maintain a safe environment, and where there is sufficient evidence to suggest that their course of action is justified, we will support them.

* Each staff member will make judgements according to their own training and experiences, and we support those decisions that are taken in order to create a safe working environment and to reduce the risk to health in any given situation.

* Adventure Ardeche policies and procedures are published for guidance and we recognise that qualified and experienced staff will use their expertise to design appropriate solutions for different situations, locations and guest types.

* The nature of our business is such that the aims and objectives of our guests may be to increase the risks that they take. Our policy is to ensure that these risks are reduced to a reasonable level and that the guest is fully aware of the hazards and the consequences.

* We will always support a guest in achieving their objectives as safely as possible, and will advise and instruct a guest in support of his or her objectives. Where a guests’ objectives and intentions are not conducive to a safe and positive outcome we will advise against their actions and prevent them from proceeding where appropriate.

* We expect that the standard and practises specified by the National Governing Bodies are, on the whole, adopted as a basic minimum standard for the relevant activities, and where no specification has been made, that the staff involved discuss their intended safe operating practises with the Leadership Team or persons notified by them (*Technical Advisors*).

### How to look after clients
What we expect, what the guest can expect, what legal responsibilities we have and what should not be done!

!!! note ""
    **Note**

    Adventure Ardeche is not intended to be an organisation that offers poor or even average standards of service. We expect that all staff working within Adventure Ardeche perform to an excellent standard, which is clearly obvious to all. 

#### The following criteria are laid down as the result of feedback from past guests who have found our service to be excellent.

Our guests can expect the following from all personnel:

* High standards of personal presentation.
* Exceptional punctuality.
* Attention to detail.
* A focus on the guest experience at all times.
* Polite, courteous and proactively helpful behaviour.
* Open, honest communication.
* High standards of technical skill.
* Clear and appropriate instruction.
* Safe practice.
* An enabling, inspiring and enjoyable experience.

### Standard Staff Practices

We expect that a staff member carries out the following regardless of the activity they are undertaking. These guidelines are offered as a check for all staff– we recognise that different methods may be used to achieve these results.

* Get one or more appropriate weather forecasts.
* Gather up to date information about your guests (medical, fitness, behavioural and dietary) from the Leadership Team or directly from the participants.
* Ensure that your  Leadership Team knows your intended route or activity site, ETA and party details.
* Ensure that you have any activity appropriate kit with you.
* Identify yourself to the group, introduce yourself by name, and ensure that all accompanying adults are aware of your role.
* Clearly identify the role you want any accompanying adults to take, even if it is a passive role. 
* Ensure that each client is appropriately dressed and equipped for the activity.
* Carry, and know how to use appropriate 1st Aid, safety and rescue equipment.
* Provide a clear overview and briefing for all activities and re-brief whenever the activity changes.
* Learn the first names of all of your guests.
* Watch for individuals struggling and provide additional help and encouragement.
* Provide clear warnings in advance of any significant hazard followed by appropriate instruction and equipment as required.
* Record any incidents or accidents in the appropriate place and notify the Leadership Team

### Standard Instructor Kit
All instructors must ensure the following is available at any time during an activity:

* First aid kit
* Group shelter or large survival bag
* Reliable light source if operating in the evenings
* Any safety or rescue equipment appropriate to the prevailing and anticipated conditions, the nature of the activity and the number, type and ability of guests. This might normally include spare clothing, food/energy source, hydration and an appropriate form of communication.

### Basic Philosophies
Whilst engaging in an activity for the pure element of participation and fun is valuable, many of our guests are at a period of their development where sound role-modelling and example is of great benefit to them. As an Instructor at Adventure Ardeche you are in an enviable position where the example you set is a foundational block in a guests life journey, use that position/opportunity with clear thought.
