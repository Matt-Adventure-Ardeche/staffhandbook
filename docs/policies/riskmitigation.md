# Risk Mitigation

## A Simple Risk Assessment Process

_**Look, explore, listen, etc**_ - get to know the environment that you are working in, and the potential interaction between you, your participants and that environment. There is no point in assessing a risk without knowledge of the full implications.

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight:bold;font-size:1.1rem">Risk level = how bad could it be x the chance of it happening</div>

!!! danger

    _Rate the worst probable and possible consequence due to that hazard on a scale of 1-5:_
    
    * Cause for minor concern e.g. a small graze, helmet rash, a small bruise;
    * Minor injuries treatable with a first aid kit but which wouldn’t normally require the attention of a medical officer e.g. cuts, twists, scratch
    * Injuries or ailments requiring evacuation and medical attention e.g. mild hypothermia, animal bites, an untreatable asthma attack, lacerations requiring stitches, minor breaks.
    * Major trauma, epileptic seizure, head injury, major broken bones, significant burns, hypothermia, hyperthermia
    * Death, paralysis, dismemberment, high voltage/high current electrocution, freezing.

!!! warning "Likelyhood"

    _Rate the chances of that hazard occurring on a scale of 1-5:_

    * Almost never – e.g. lightning striking close to your party
    * Highly unlikely e.g. the chance of someone letting go of the rope whilst abseiling
    * Happening every so often e.g. a serious change in weather
    * Likely, if not probable e.g. a pebble falling off the top of an abseil pitch or a child tripping on rough ground
    * Certain or almost certain to happen e.g. someone in your party getting tired on a long walk.

!!! success "Outcome"

    6-8 is acceptable in outdoor activities (Although you may be able to reduce it with concise instruction and warnings).

!!! danger
    
    **8+? You must reduce it**

If you identify a hazard and assess the risk to be greater than 8 you are expected to take steps to reduce the risk, which means clearly and concisely identifying the hazard to all people in your party, giving clear, concise instruction, issuing appropriate equipment and (_unless your purpose***** is to lead your clients through the hazardous environment_) leading them away from the hazard towards an environment in which the risk is acceptable.

* _If you are contracted to lead clients up an ice climb (as an example), their purpose would be to tackle any hazards encountered including those rated above level 8 because the clients’ enjoyment and fulfilment comes from that level of risk acceptance. However, even at this level the instructor should be taking reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of his/her clients - so a risk level 12 may be acceptable._
