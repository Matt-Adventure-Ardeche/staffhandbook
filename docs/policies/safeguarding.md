# Child Protection & Safeguarding

Effective safeguarding systems are child centred. Failings in safeguarding systems are too often the result of losing sight of the needs and views of the children within them, or placing the interests of adults ahead of the needs of children. Children want to be respected, their views to be heard, to have stable relationships with professionals built on trust and for consistent support provided for their individual needs. This should guide the behaviour of professionals.

Anyone working with children should see and speak to the child; listen to what they say; take their views seriously; and work with them collaboratively when deciding how to support their needs.

## Children have said that they need:
* **Vigilance:** to have adults notice when things are troubling them;
* **Understanding and action:** to understand what is happening; to be heard and understood; and to have that understanding acted upon;
* **Stability:** to be able to develop an on-going stable relationship of trust with those helping them;
* **Respect:** to be treated with the expectation that they are competent rather than not;
Information and engagement: to be informed about and involved in procedures, decisions, concerns and plans;
* **Explanation:** to be informed of the outcome of assessments and decisions and reasons when their views have not met with a positive response;
* **Support:** to be provided with support in their own right as well as a member of their family;
* **Advocacy:** to be provided with advocacy to assist them in putting forward their views.

### Effective ongoing action to keep the child in focus also includes:
* Eliciting the child's wishes and feelings - about their situation now as well as plans and hopes for the future;
* Providing children with honest and accurate information about the current situation, as seen by professionals, and future possible actions and interventions;
* Involving the child in key decision-making;
* Providing appropriate information to the child about his or her right to protection and assistance;
* Inviting children to make recommendations about the services and assistance they need and/or are available to them;
* Ensuring children have access to independent advice and support, to be able to express their views, and influence decision-making.

Even initial discussions with children should be conducted in a way that minimises any distress caused to them and maximises the likelihood that they will provide helpful information. Children may need time and more than one opportunity in order to develop sufficient trust to communicate any concerns they may have, especially if they have a communication impairment, learning disabilities, are very young or are experiencing mental health problems.

## Protocols
* Nominated Person for Child Protection/Safeguarding
* Adhere to Best Practice wherever possible
  
    ### Best Practice means
    * Always working in an open environment (e.g. avoiding private or unobserved situations and encouraging open communication with no secrets).
    * Treating all young people/disabled adults with respect and dignity.
    * Always putting the welfare of each young person first, before achieving goals or winning.
    * Maintaining a safe and appropriate distance (e.g. it is not appropriate for staff or volunteers to have an intimate relationship with a child or to share a room with them).
    * Building relationships based on mutual trust, which empowers children to share in the decision-making process.
    * Making activities fun, enjoyable and promoting fair play, without prejudice.
    * Ensuring that if any form of manual/physical support is required, it should be provided openly and appropriately. Care is needed, as it is difficult to position hands appropriately in certain circumstances. Young people should ideally be consulted and their agreement gained where possible. Some parents are becoming increasingly sensitive about manual support and their views should always be carefully considered.
    * Involving parents/carers/teachers whenever appropriate. For example, engaging them to take responsibility for their children in the changing rooms. If groups have to be supervised in the changing rooms, try to ensure that parents, teachers, instructors or volunteers work in pairs.
    * Ensuring that where possible, a male and female member of staff should always accompany mixed groups. However, remember that same-gender abuse can also occur.
    * Ensuring that during residential events, adults should avoid entering children’s bedrooms and should never invite children into their private rooms.
    * Being an excellent role model – this includes not smoking or drinking alcohol in the company of young people.
    Giving enthusiastic and constructive feedback rather than negative criticism.
    * Recognising the developmental needs and capacity of young people with and without disabilities – avoiding excessive physical activity or competition and not pushing them against their will.


* Create and Maintain an Anti-Bullying environment
* Recruit staff safely. Ensure **ALL** relevant checks are made.
* Effective management through Supervision, Support, Training, Monitoring, Quality Assurance.
* Provision of a **Safe Environment** at all times, by applying best practice **Health & Safety** guidance and other legal requirements.
* Manage any allegations appropriately and in a timely manner. 

!!! note 
    
    Staff/volunteers are not trained to deal with situations of abuse or to decide if abuse has occurred.
