# Disciplinary & Grievence

**Outline**

As your employer Adventure Ardeche could start a formal disciplinary action against you if there are concerns about your Work, Conduct, or persistant Absence, Lateness etc.

Before taking action or dismissing you, Adventure Ardeche will raise the matter informally with you.  That will be through either the Centre Manager or one of the Leadership Team. However Adventure Ardeche can go directly to a formal disciplinary or dismissal.

!!! Info
    Disciplinary Procedures are a set way for your employer to deal with disciplinary issues. They should include a hearing where you're given a chance to explain your side of the story. There will also be a chance to appeal any action Adventure Ardeche decides to take.

During any formal process you can have one other person of your choosing to accompany you, to listen to the conversation and for you to confer with. The support person, however, may not take ANY direct role in the process.

It is the responsibility of both Adventure Ardeche and the employee to deal with any Disciplinary or Grievance in a timely manner without unreasonable delay to raising the issue, meetings, decisions or confirmation of any decision.

The following conducts may affect whether you're deemed to have stepped over the line:

- Bringing the company into disrepute.
- Inappropriate behaviour in the presence/vicinity of any Guest.
- Persistent Poor Time Keeping.
- Dereliction of Duty of Care towards Guests.
- Working outside of Adventure Ardeche norms, Unsafe, Poor performance or working practices.
- Under the influence of Drugs or Alcohol during working hours.

Adventure Ardeche disciplinary procedure includes the following steps:

1. A letter/email/interaction setting out the issue.

## Grievance Policy
All staff can raise concerns, problems, or complaints.  You can do this through one of the Leadership Team directly in writing.

Once you have raised a grievance Adventure Ardeche will arrange a meeting to discuss the issue. You may also have a support person accompany you to any meeting.
