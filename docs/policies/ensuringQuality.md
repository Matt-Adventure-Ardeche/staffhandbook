- [ ] # Ensuring Quality

This document is in place to ensure that our clientâ€™s experience is of high quality. It is based on 5 fundamental standards.

* Planning the experience
* Providing accurate information to guests
* Providing adventures which meet the needs of guests
* Reviewing client experiences
* Safety and Risk management

Prior to a client visiting we aim to capture their learning needs; we do this either through pre arrival communication via email or telephone conversation. Where this is not possible, we discuss learning outcomes as part of our welcome meeting with visiting staff. Once captured, this information is then shared with staff working with the group.

## Providing accurate information to guests

It is of the utmost importance to us that we provide accurate, honest information to our guests in advance of travel. This includes, the quality and experience of staff, all costs being discussed and agreed in advance of travel and that all activities and accommodation are as agreed. 

## Providing adventures that meet the needs of guests

We make use of different locations and activities depending on the needs of guests. There are different sections of river that can be used, different crags and different excursion venues. Working with guests in advance of their trip and during, can make sure that we meet their needs.

## Reviewing client experiences

Feedback is collected through daily conversations with visiting staff and group leaders. This feedback is reflected upon and working with the **Leadership Team**, changes can be made to the programme and staff coached to ensure learning outcomes are met. In addition to this we ask for feedback from group leaders once they have returned from their trip. 

## Safety and Risk Management

Safety and risk management is of fundamental importance to us. We have adopted the **Outdoor Education Activity Providors** national guidance for our approach to this area. Our approach can be summarised in the following sentence.
