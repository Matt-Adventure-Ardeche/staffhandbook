# Emergency Procedure

- [ ] <span style="color:red">ToDo.!</span>
  
## During the Incident
During an Emergency you will not have time to read this guidance – you will be reliant on training and effective/practised systems.

## Immediate Action
Assess the situation, establishing the nature and extent of the problem but ensuring that the leaders do not put themselves or others at further risk.

**Make sure all other members of the party are:**

* Accounted for.
* Safe.
* Adequately supervised.
* Briefed to ensure that they understand what to do to remain safe. Leaders should assume their allocated roles - ensuring that where one or more of the Visit Leadership Team is incapacitated then these roles are reassigned on a priority basis.
* If there are injuries, take action to establish their extent and administer appropriate first aid.

## First Aid

**Aim to:**

* Preserve life.
* Prevent the condition from worsening.
* Promote recovery - Treat for shock – Reassure and keep warm.

## Communications
Direct contact with a Parent of a group member, from the scene of the incident should be avoided. This task should be carried out by senior staff. 

1. Contact the appropriate emergency service(s). They will guide you through the information they need but this will include:
   1. Your name and the name of the Group
   2. Location
   3. Nature of emergency and number of injured persons
   4. Action so far
2. Alert the Establishment/Employer’s Emergency Contact. You may be in shock and need support. Also, news travels fast and your Establishment/Employer will need accurate information.
3. Consider other people who may need contacting
   1. Police
   2. Embassy/Consulate if abroad
   3. Local accommodation/contact
   4. Tour operator/provider
   5. Insurer 
   
4. DO NOT speak to the media. Refer all media interest/enquiries to the Establishment/Employer.
5. Control any communications by the rest of the group. Rumours spread very quickly and can cause serious and unnecessary upset.

## Secondary Action
1. Arrange appropriate protection from the elements.
2. Uninjured group members should be moved to shelter or away from the immediate vicinity of any casualties.
   1. **Ensure that they:**
      1. Are adequately supervised throughout
      2. Are returned as early as possible to base
      3. Receive appropriate support and reassurance.
3. Avoid splitting the group – unless it is the only way to get help – and leave nobody on their own.
4. Manage the incident - ensure that all appropriate actions have been/are being attended to
5. It is useful to keep an accurate record of events and actions as close to real time as possible. Any leader with spare capacity should, therefore, keep notes – see the section below on recording an incident.
6. Ensure that an appropriate adult accompanies any casualties to hospital, taking with them parental consent forms and appropriate medical information for the injured persons. 
7. Maintain contact with the emergency services and the Establishment/Employer contact until the Emergency is over. 
8. Monitor, reassess and review – ensure nothing has been forgotten and all leaders and young people are coping, cared for and secure. 

## Post-Incident Action 
1. Consider the emotional needs of any leaders or young people who may have been adversely affected. 
2. Follow your Employer’s and Establishment’s reporting requirements, including completing any accident and incident forms and complying with Reporting of Incidents, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrence Regulations. 
3. Review the lessons learned and ensure that these feed into future visit plans, emergency plans and staff training.
4. Share the experience and learning with colleagues

## Media/legal points 
* Do not admit anything. 
* Do not sign anything. 
* Avoid discussing legal liability with others. 
* Do not talk to the press – refer them to your employer’s media contact. 
* Record all events, times and details – establish witness contact details and get statements from leaders

## Recording an incident 
Make an accurate record of all details as soon as possible – do not leave this until later when your memory of details may be confused

## Record the following:
* time, date and nature of the incident. 
* accurate incident location.
* names of casualties.
* details of injuries.
* actions taken, including all communications.
* names of others involved but not injured.
* details of any moves from the incident site (times, who moved, where to, how).
* names and contact details of witnesses.
* proposed actions. 

As soon as is practicable the incident will be reported on the incident report form.


## Emergency & Critical Incidents
Serious incidents and accidents are very rare, but they can happen. Minor incidents, accidents or emergencies are more common. We aim to reduce the exposure to these risks through our safety and risk management system. In doing so we believe that our staff and our client’s exposure to risk is reduced.

### A hierarchy of emergencies
When we consider how things might go wrong, we categorise these emergencies into three separate areas. We like these terms because they sound distinct from one another. We wouldn’t want confusion about the severity of the situation when calling out from a poor phone connection; or a case of ‘*broken telephone*’ as the message is passed from one person to another.

### Everything’s ok
**Everything’s ok** is used when no immediate help is required from resources outside of Adventure Ardeche. There might have been an incident that needs to be communicated about, a request for resources later, an update, etc. 

The accident / incident book is completed following the event.

### Minor
A **Minor** situation is usually an evacuation of a person off of the trip which requires non-emergency support and transport.

The accident / incident book is completed following the event.

### Emergency
An **Emergency** situation is one that is life or limb threatening and time sensitive. We would request outside help from emergency services such as the police, ambulance, or pompier.

## Protocol
* All of our staff will be trained in the Emergency procedure
* All lead instructors will have a charged mobile phone whilst working with clients
* All of our staff will be first aid trained
* Scenario based tests of the emergency procedure and critical incident plan will occur at least once per season.
