A location where clients and staff could be evacuated immediately in the event of an emergency will be identified prior to the start of the operating season.  This venue should be close to the Base Du Cros and large enough to provide temporary shelter.

* Instruction in the use of fire alarms
* Location of fire assembly points

If a fire is found by a member of Adventure Ardeche staff they will use their own judgement on whether to raise the alarm or tackle the fire.

If the fire is small and there is no immediate threat to clients or staff the fire should be tackled using the appropriate fire fighting equipment.

If the fire is near to staff or client accommodation the fire alarm should always be raised. The fire may then be tackled using the appropriate fire fighting equipment if it is deemed safe to do so.

**If the fire alarm is raised the following procedure will be implemented:**
* In the event of the fire alarm being raised the most senior member of staff on duty will collect the Live File, Visitors Book and Staff Rotas from the office. If the source and scale of the fire is known at this stage the fire brigade should be called immediately or an appointed person should tackle the fire accordingly.
* The most senior member of staff will then proceed immediately to the fire/flood assembly point and take on the role of Fire Officer.
* All other available members of staff will direct all clients, off-duty staff and visitors to the fire assembly point.
* On arrival at the fire assembly point the Fire Officer will appoint duty members of staff to search the site for the source of the fire and to ensure that the site is fully evacuated. 
* A full roll call will be taken including clients, staff and visitors.
* The Fire Officer will present themselves to the fire brigade with all available information - such as location and scale of fire, any persons unaccounted for, etc - and take direction from them. At this stage the Emergency Procedure will be implemented and depending on the scale of the incident the Site Evacuation Plan may be put into action.

**Only the Fire Officer can end the fire alarm. This should be done when either:**
* The Fire Officer being assured that the alarm was false
* The Fire Officer being assured that any fire is extinguished and that there is no further risk
* The Fire Officer is given the all clear from the fire brigade


At any appropriate stage a more senior member of staff can take on the role of Fire Officer.
