!!! info "Learning Objectives"    

    You should define the knowledge and skill set of your target audience before starting. You can then use this information to avoid wasting time explaining information your audience already knows.   

Just as stories are used to define software, learning objectives can be written using a standard template:

_As a `user` of the `solution` I `know a specific piece of information`, or `can perform a specific task`._

### For each learning objective, you should:

Identify what your audience should know and be able to do after they have read the documentation, and/or participated in the activity. Use that information to create a list of **Learning Objectives**.

Clearly worded learning objectives enable you to focus the content on comprehensive and coherent goals. Learning objectives should be evident in the title and content.

If there is no existing documentation set, some areas will be well documented, while others will either be poorly defined or missing. Expect to find duplicate and outdated content. Maintain a list of the best documentation you find for any learning objective.
