# Shaping the AA Programme

    What can we focus on in regards participant learning during the Adventure Ardeche experience?

The following skills are essential for young people to be able to grow into for their futures.

## PROBLEM-SOLVING

When young people solve problems independently, they will be happier, more confident and more independent; they will not feel frustrated or disheartened by their inefficiency.

Outdoor learning experiences allow students of all ages to experience risk and adventure at a developmentally appropriate pace. Students experience hands-on learning and engage in authentic problem-solving in ways they cannot experience with the same depth in traditional settings. Outdoor learning experiences provide immediate feedback, meaning students can quickly identify mistakes, make changes and discover how failures can lead to new understandings.

## COMMUNICATION

Communication skills are among the most crucial skills for students in today's world. At all levels of education and beyond, students must be able to communicate effectively. 

Adventure Ardeche programmes provide outcomes focusing on verbal, non-verbal and visual communication, active listening, emotional control, adaptability and interpersonal skills.

Through outdoor activities, young people exercise their active listening and adaptive communication skills.

## TEAMWORK

Unsurprisingly, getting along and engaging with others is vital for many things in life; it is a core social skill. Young people need to learn how to give and take, share, take turns, play to their strengths and draw in others. 

Adventure Ardeche programmes heighten skills in communication, conflict resolution, rapport-building, persuasion, and organisational and planning outcomes.

Outdoor education provides rich personal and social development opportunities through carefully structured group activities in challenging situations. Working together in the classroom looks very different from, say, building a raft. In this environment, students quickly understand their success means the success of their group and become far more aware of how to support those around them.

## COMMUNITY AND SOCIAL CONNECTION

Social connection is critical to physical and mental wellbeing in people of all ages, it brings a feeling of being accepted and appreciated for their best qualities.

Adventure Ardeche programmes deliver outcomes of social responsibility, compassion, relationship management, cooperation, flexibility, self-belief, respect and communal living.

Sharing a new and exciting adventure in the outdoors enhances friendship and camaraderie among students.

## ACCEPTING CHALLENGE

As they grow, young people encounter increasing stresses and obstacles. To thrive, young people must develop strengths, acquire skills to cope, recover from hardships, and be prepared for future challenges; they need to be resilient.

In accepting challenges and stepping outside their comfort zones, students develop resilience and coping strategies, equipping them with the skills needed to confront the obstacles they are bound to face in life. Through the Asventure Ardeche experience, students are permitted to constructively explore and ask questions in an encouraging environment, supported by experienced staff.

## LEADERSHIP

Students need to experience leadership opportunities during their schooling and learn the art of building relationships within teams. Leadership skills allow young people to understand they have the ability to make things happen. Exercising leadership skills instils confidence and helps young people solve problems creatively and work collaboratively with others.

Leadership is something young people develop through their experiences. Outdoor education programmes enhance student leadership and allow them to practice and hone their skills in a supportive learning environment. Through varied group activities, each student is provided with a chance to shine and explore just what leadership means to them. Students begin to understand their strengths, learn the value of persevering, remain calm under pressure and know when to ask for help.

## PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY

When students take on responsibility, they readily accept the outcome of their choices without holding anybody else accountable by reflecting on their beliefs, ideas, goals, mistakes and achievements. Responsibility requires young people to explore a response proportional to a problem, adapting to obstacles as they arise.

Time at Adventure Ardeche aims to enhance resilience, self-worth, decision-making, honesty, respect, a sense of fairness, accountability, and courage.

Outdoor education offers unique opportunities for increased responsibility young people may not have elsewhere in their lives and carry with them inherent feelings of maturity and self-belief. On programme, young people can make decisions for themselves in unfamiliar environments and face new consequences and rewards, for example, what to wear, what to eat, and how they contribute to their group. Naturally, young people will learn and grow from their successes and mistakes and become more confident in tackling future obstacles.

## EMPATHY

Empathy is a powerful tool; it is a key element of emotional intelligence, linking oneself and others. Those who have empathy better understand the perspectives, needs, and intentions of others and can work through difficult moments from a position of strength. Empathetic students are more cooperative, have better relationships  and are more engaged.

When students are tired, sore, and uncomfortable, the lessons learnt often teach them more about personal strength and empathy than any classroom or textbook. After a day of adventure, we encourage reflection. Students listen to and share their experiences of the day, allowing them to hear their peers' perspectives on it and compare them with their own.

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONNECTION

Connecting young people to the natural world is more vital than ever. Environmental literacy allows young people to understand how their actions affect the environment, builds the knowledge necessary to address complex ecological issues, and imparts practical ways to keep our environment flourishing for the future.

Adventure Ardeche aim to enhance outcomes around environmental literacy and sustainable practices, creativity, innovative and critical thinking, foresight, negotiation, collaboration, community projects and an investigative mind. 

To prepare our young people for a complex world, they need environmental connection as a foundation upon which to make choices for their future. Connecting young people to the natural world prepares them for citizenship and encourages them to share their voices and make a positive difference.

## BUILDING TRUST

Trust allows young people to feel part of a relationship or group, with a shared purpose and a willingness to depend on each other – this is vital in the classroom and in a work environment. Students who trust those around them will display more positive behaviour and take on more responsibility.

Learning to trust and how to navigate social interactions takes practice. Our programmes provide young people with endless opportunities to exercise and build trust – not only in their peers but in themselves too. Reading a map setting off sown the river can feel overwhelming. However, during our programmes, students understand they can lean on their peers for help; they are encouraged to recognise and trust their peers' abilities and support one another.

## WELLBEING

Wellbeing is a multi-faceted concept involving much more than just physical health. It's a combination of a person's emotional, mental and social health and it also reflects how they feel about themselves and their life in general. Overall, wellbeing enhances motivation, decreases disciplinary problems, increases academic achievement and improves satisfaction.

The physical and mental health benefits of simply being in the natural world are increasingly understood and accepted by governments locally and around the world. Exposing young people to natural environments reduces stress and increases wellbeing. Outdoor education is key to supporting young peoples' mental health. 

## POSITIVE EDUCATION AND MINDFULNESS

Positive education has been defined as "education for both traditional skills and for happiness;" strengthening traditional skills while also fostering positive character strength and enhancing student wellbeing and happiness.

Through positive education and mindfulness, students have fewer potential obstacles standing in the way of their progress.
